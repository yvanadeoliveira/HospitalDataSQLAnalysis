# 🏥 Hospital Data SQL Analysis

**Tools:** MySQL  

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This SQL-based analysis explores synthetic hospital data from **Massachusetts General Hospital** (MGH), covering the period **2011–2022**. The dataset includes information on **~1,000 patients**, **medical encounters**, **procedures**, **insurance coverage**, and **payer details**.  

As a **Data Analyst** at a healthcare consulting firm, my assignment was to help prepare MGH's **annual performance report** by uncovering insights into patient behavior, encounter patterns, medical procedures, and financial costs. The goal: support **care optimization** and **cost efficiency**.

## 🗂️ Dataset Summary

- **Source:** SyntheticMass
- **Total Records:** ~75,000 across 4 main tables
- **Tables Involved:**
  - `encounters`: Hospital visits (type, cost, reason)
  - `patients`: Demographics and geography
  - `procedures`: Clinical procedures and base costs
  - `payers`: Insurance companies

---

## 🔍 Analysis Objectives

### 1. **Encounters Overview**
- Number of hospital encounters per year
- Distribution of encounter types (e.g., emergency, wellness)
- Percentage of encounters <24h vs. >24h

### 2. **Cost & Coverage Insights**
- Number and share of encounters with **zero payer coverage**
- **Top 10 most common** vs. **most expensive** procedures
- Average **claim cost by payer**

### 3. **Patient Behavior**
- Unique patient admissions per quarter
- Patients readmitted within 30 days
- Patients with **highest number of readmissions**

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- There was a consistent increase in **inpatient** and **emergency visits** after 2019.
- ~96% of all hospital visits lasted **more than 24 hours**, indicating high-acuity care needs.
- **Procedure costs** varied widely: some frequent procedures had **low average cost**, while rare ones were **extremely expensive**.
- A small cohort of patients had **multiple readmissions** in a short timeframe, signaling possible gaps in post-discharge care.
- Certain **insurance providers** showed significantly **higher average claim costs**.

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Used

- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- **Aggregate functions**: `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `ROUND`
- **Conditional logic**: `CASE WHEN`
- **Window functions**: `LEAD()` for readmission analysis
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for cleaner subqueries
- **Date/time functions**: `YEAR()`, `QUARTER()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `TIMESTAMPDIFF()`

---

## ✅ Next Steps & Improvements

- Visualize trends (e.g., encounter types by year) in **Power BI** or **Tableau**
- Join with the `patients` table to analyze readmissions by **age group**, **gender**, or **geography**
- Flag **high-risk patients** (e.g., 3+ readmissions in 90 days) for care management
